# TripleS and ARTMS Objekts

An application to view Objekts outside the [Cosmo](https://www.triplescosmos.com/) app, directly accessing the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network to obtain information about items, sales, trades, and votes.

## Objekts

Objekts are photocards, common items in the K-Pop industry, but in a digital version. Objekts are NFTs hosted on the Polygon network, ensuring that users receive the items reliably and cost-effectively.

Currently, Objekts exist for the groups under Modhaus:

- [TripleS](https://www.triplescosmos.com/)
- [ARTMS](https://artms-strategy.com/)

Both groups have their Objekts, which are released periodically. They can be acquired directly through the Cosmo app or received as gifts during special events held by the groups.

## The Application

The application serves to display all released photocards and detailed information such as series, member, group, etc.

Currently, the application has the functionality to filter by group (TripleS or ARTMS) and by member of each group.

## Future Functionalities

In the future, I will implement new functionalities such as:

- [ ] 3D photocard viewing
- [ ] Series filter
- [ ] Image caching
- [ ] Search bar
- [ ] Viewing the appâ€™s voting results
